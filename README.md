# Linux Server Configuration
In this project we will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host our web applications. We will secure our server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of our existing web applications onto it.

## Getting Started

### Update all currently installed packages
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```
